                    <p>It’s been over 20 years since “See you, Space Cowboy” made waves throughout the anime industry. 
                    And at this point, you’d be hard pressed to find an anime fan who hasn’t, in fact, seen that Space
                    Cowboy. We’re blasting off with Cowboy Bebop, taking a deep dive into the worlds, stars, characters 
                    and space opera genre as a whole. <a href="https://www.funimation.com/blog/2019/07/05/cowboy-bebop-and-the-influence-of-a-genre/">Click here for more</a>

            <p>It, a mysterious immortal being, is sent to the Earth with no 
                emotions nor identity. However, It is able to take the shape of 
                those around that have a strong impetus. At first, It is a sphere. 
                Then, It imitates the form of a rock. As the temperature drops and snow
                falls atop the moss, It inherits the moss. When an injured, a lone wolf comes
                limping by and lays down to die, It takes on the form of the animal. Finally, It gains 
                consciousness and begins to traverse the empty tundra until It meets a boy. The boy lives alone 
                in a ghost town, which the adults abandoned long ago in search of the paradise said to exist far 
                beyond the endless sea of white tundra. However, their efforts were for naught, and now the boy is in 
                a critical state. Acquiring the form of the boy, It sets off on a never-ending journey, 
                in search of new experiences, places, and people.

            <p>A Homunculus is an artificially created human, presumably brought into existence by 
                certain means of alchemy. Though a common concept, well known and understood by 
                alchemists in Amestris, the idea of the Homunculus is regarded as no more than a 
                farce or faraway fantasy as no individual or group of alchemists has come anywhere 
                close to successfully creating such a being in officially recorded history.However, 
                off the official record, not only one but several of these creatures have been created
                in arcane, sinister secrecy. These Homunculi are the main antagonists of the Fullmetal 
                Alchemist series, each carrying the mark of the Ouroboros upon their bodies and named
                after the seven deadly sins: Pride, Lust, Greed, Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth, and Envy.
